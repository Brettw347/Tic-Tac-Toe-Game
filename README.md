# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

## Description
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. This project demonstrates the use of loops, user input, and classes.

### Bugs/Issues
- Game closes when the user inputs an invalid option
- Code is janky and hard to read

### NOTE
This project is under a massive overhaul. File names, functions, and more are going to be changed for clarity and consiceness. See below for expected changes.

### Future Changes:
- Decreasing amount of code, condensing if statements
- Split up larger functions into smaller ones
- Clarify where players are placing their 'X' or 'O'
- Add AI difficulty modes (Easy, Medium, Hard)
